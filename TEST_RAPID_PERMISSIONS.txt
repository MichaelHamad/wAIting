Testing 30-second lookback window for rapid successive permissions.

Test timestamp: 2026-01-03 17:15
Fix: Implemented lookback window - checks if user was active in last 30s

Problem being fixed:
- User approves Permission Dialog A
- Permission Dialog B appears immediately after (same second or within seconds)
- OLD BEHAVIOR: Bell plays for B even though user just proved they're present
- NEW BEHAVIOR: No bell for B if A was approved within last 30 seconds

Test scenario:
1. Trigger multiple permission dialogs in rapid succession
2. Approve the FIRST dialog quickly (within 10 seconds - before grace period)
3. Observe if bell plays for the SECOND dialog

Expected result:
- NO bell should play for Dialog B if you approved Dialog A within the last 30 seconds
- This prevents annoying bells when you're actively approving permissions

Technical details:
- Lookback window: 30 seconds (configurable in ~/.waiting.json)
- Grace period: 10 seconds (unchanged)
- Activity check: last_activity > (START_TIMESTAMP - 30)
- Debug log: /tmp/waiting-debug.log

To test:
1. Make sure you restarted Claude Code after running: pip install -e . && waiting
2. Trigger this permission by editing multiple files rapidly
3. Approve first dialog quickly
4. Second dialog should NOT play bell (you're clearly present)
