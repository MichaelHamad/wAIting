Testing Session 4 Fix #5: Continuous Monitoring

Problem Fixed:
- Lookback window caused nag to EXIT entirely if user was recently active
- User could sit at permission dialog for 20 minutes with no bell

New Behavior:
- If user active in last 30s → skip FIRST bell, but keep monitoring
- Nag loop checks: "Did user respond to THIS dialog?" (activity > START_TIMESTAMP)
- If user goes AFK → bells start playing

Test timestamp: 2026-01-03 19:00
Expected: Bell plays after 10s (you were active recently from this message)
Then: Approve it and bell should stop instantly
