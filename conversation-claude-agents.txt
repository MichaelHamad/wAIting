Conversation: Understanding CLAUDE.md and Claude Agent SDK
=========================================================

USER:
how can I use claude.md to help you? Also I would like to learn more about
anthrophic sdk for the multistep workflows

CLAUDE:

## How CLAUDE.md Helps Me

It's a way to give me persistent context about your project. Every time you
start a conversation, I read it automatically. Think of it as "onboarding
notes" for an AI assistant.

**Practical things to include:**

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Commands
- `pip install -e .` - Install in dev mode
- `python -m pytest tests/` - Run tests
- `python -m waiting <cmd>` - Run the tool

## Architecture
- PTY wrapper spawns child process via pty.fork()
- Detector uses state machine (RUNNING/WAITING)
- Bell + optional desktop notifications

## Conventions
- No external dependencies (stdlib only)
- Python 3.10+
- Use dataclasses for event types

## Current Status
- [ ] Scaffolding
- [ ] Core implementation
- [ ] Tests
```

This means I won't ask "how do I run tests?" or "what's the structure?" -
I'll already know.

## Claude Agent SDK

The Claude Agent SDK is a framework for building autonomous AI agents and
multi-step workflows using Claude as the reasoning engine.

### Main Features and Capabilities

1. **Multi-Step Task Execution** - Build workflows where agents can reason
   through complex problems step-by-step
2. **Tool Integration** - Connect agents to custom tools and APIs
3. **Session Management** - Manage agent state across interactions
4. **MCP Integration** - Use Model Context Protocol to connect external systems
5. **Multiple Language Support** - Python and TypeScript/Node.js

### Conceptual Example

```python
from anthropic_sdk import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="research-agent",
    model="claude-opus-4-5",
    tools=[search_tool, database_tool, email_tool]
)

# Agent autonomously figures out the steps
result = agent.run("Research market trends and email me a summary")
```

The agent would:
1. Search for market data
2. Query relevant databases
3. Synthesize findings
4. Compose and send the email

All without you coding each step explicitly.

### Where to Learn More
- https://docs.anthropic.com - Main documentation
- Look for "Agent SDK" section for Python/TypeScript guides

USER:
so the agents.md would only be used for something like those example use
cases? not something like an agent in our internal project would use

CLAUDE:

## "Agent" Has Two Meanings

| Term                              | What It Is                                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Agent** (Claude Agent SDK)   | Uses an LLM to *reason* and *decide* next steps|
| **Software Agent/Daemon**         | Any autonomous program that runs and does task |

## Your "waiting" Tool

It's a **software agent** in the traditional sense - it runs, monitors, and
takes action (alerts). But it:
- Has **hardcoded logic** (state machine, heuristics)
- **No AI involved** - pure deterministic code
- Doesn't need Claude to "think" about what to do

**Claude Agent SDK is irrelevant here.**

## When You'd Use Claude Agent SDK

If your tool needed to **make judgment calls**, like:
- "Is this output *actually* a prompt or just slow processing?"
- "Should I escalate this notification based on context?"
- "Summarize what the command was doing when it stalled"

Then you'd pipe data to Claude and let it reason. But that's overkill for
your use case - simple heuristics (raw mode + prompt patterns) are more
efficient and don't require API calls.

## TL;DR

Your `waiting` tool = traditional systems programming, no AI needed.

Claude Agent SDK = for when you want AI to autonomously figure out *how*
to accomplish a goal.
