Testing Session 4 fixes:

1. Pending file mechanism restored
   - Auto-approved tools (Read, Glob) don't update activity
   - Only user approvals update activity

2. SIGTERM trap added
   - Nag dies instantly when you approve
   - No waiting for sleep to complete

Test scenario:
- This Write triggers a permission dialog
- Wait 10+ seconds WITHOUT approving
- Bell should play (you're AFK)
- Approve the dialog
- Bell should stop INSTANTLY (SIGTERM trap)
- Check debug log to verify pending file logic

Expected log entries:
- PermissionRequest: "Created pending marker"
- PreToolUse (auto-approved): "Auto-approved tool, no activity update"
- PreToolUse (user approval): "User approved permission, updated activity"
